Of course. It is absolutely essential to have a `README.md` that reflects the current, modernized state of the project. A good README is the front door for any developer interacting with your code; it should be clear, accurate, and helpful.

The old README is completely outdated and would cause confusion. Here is a professionally written, completely new `README.md` file that accurately describes the project in its final form. It incorporates all of your requirements, provides clean instructions, and properly credits the original author.

**Instructions:**

1.  Delete the entire content of your current `README.md` file.
2.  Replace it with the text provided below.
3.  Remember to replace `[Your Name/Company Name]` in the license section with your actual name or your startup's name.

# HelpDesk Bot (Enhanced Fork)
> A modern, containerized, and multilingual Telegram bot that works as a reliable helpdesk, based on the original work by J√∫lia Rizza.

This is an enhanced and modernized fork of J√∫lia Rizza's original [helpdeskbot](https://github.com/juliarizza/helpdeskbot). This version has been significantly refactored to serve as a robust, production-ready support channel for modern development teams.

When a user sends a support message to the bot, it forwards the message to a private support group. Your team can then reply directly to the forwarded message in the group, and the bot will relay the answer back to the user, handling all the routing seamlessly.

3. The client receives the answer, and the conversation continues.

## Key Features & Improvements

This fork builds upon the original concept with a focus on stability, maintainability, and user experience:

*   **üöÄ Modern Tech Stack:** Upgraded to Python 3.12 and the latest asynchronous versions of `python-telegram-bot` and `redis` libraries for improved performance and security.
*   **üê≥ Fully Containerized:** The entire application, including the Redis database, is managed via Docker and Docker Compose for simple, one-command setup and consistent, reproducible builds.
*   **üíæ Persistent Storage:** User support tickets are safely stored in a persistent Redis volume, ensuring that no conversations are lost even if the server reboots.
*   **üåê Multilingual Support:** Full localization support, pre-configured for English, Russian, and Portuguese. The bot defaults to Russian for new users.
*   **‚ú® Enhanced UX:** A streamlined, command-less user flow. The onboarding and help messages are clear and instructive, making the bot incredibly intuitive to use.
*   **üêû Bug Fixes:** The critical bug related to Telegram's forwarding privacy settings has been resolved, guaranteeing that replies work for all users, regardless of their settings.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine or server:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:shavkat-dev/helpdeskbot.git
cd helpdeskbot
```

### 2. Configure Your Bot
Create a `.env` file for your secrets by copying the template.

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
Now, edit the `.env` file and add your secret tokens:
*   `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: Get this from `@BotFather` on Telegram.
*   `GROUP_CHAT_ID`: The unique ID of the private Telegram group where support messages will be forwarded. Add a bot like `@userinfobot` to your group to find its ID.

### 3. Build and Run the Bot
Run the following command from the `support-bot` directory to build the Docker images and start the services in the background:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
Your support bot is now running! The `restart: always` policy ensures that the bot and its database will automatically restart if they crash or if the system reboots.

### Managing the Bot
*   **Viewing Logs:** To see the bot's live logs for debugging, run:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f bot
    ```
*   **Stopping the Bot:** To stop the services and remove the containers, run:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```
    *Note: This will not delete your persistent Redis data. To do that, run `docker compose down -v`.*

### Managing Dependencies
This project uses `pip-tools` to manage Python dependencies for reproducible builds.
*   The direct dependencies are listed in `requirements.in`.
*   The fully pinned dependency list is in `requirements.txt`.

To upgrade the libraries to their latest compatible versions, run:
```bash
# First, ensure pip-tools is installed
pip install pip-tools

# Then, run the upgrade command
pip-compile --upgrade
```
Afterward, commit the changes to both `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt`.
